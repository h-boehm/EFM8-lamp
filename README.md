## EFM8 lamp

An embedded C program that controls a dual-channel LED array using an EFM8 microcontroller and pulse width modulation, compiled with the Keil toolchain. It interfaces with the hardware through five tactile buttons, allowing users to toggle lamp states (on/off), switch between cool and warm channels, and adjust brightness levels. The software includes a state machine with dedicated states to manage both user inputs and lamp behavior. It also incorporates lookup tables for efficient brightness adjustment, a debouncing algorithm to eliminate button input noise, and typematic rate and delay mechanisms for smooth user interaction.
